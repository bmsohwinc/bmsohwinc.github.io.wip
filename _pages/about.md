Hello! I am Sourabha, formerly a Software Engineer (Member Technical) at [DE Shaw India](https://www.deshawindia.com/), where I specialized in enhancing massive Data warehouses and building real-time Analytics Dashboards for the Executive teams.

While my skills primarily lie in **Full-Stack development** (Java, Spring, JavaScript, React, and SQL), I'm equally passionate about AI/ML, and the recent rise of LLMs and their applications.

I'm a firm believer in Prof. Richard P. Feynman's [quote about learning](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8414-what-i-cannot-create-i-do-not-understand):
> _What I cannot create, I do not understand._

Hence, I constantly keep exploring and building upon any new technology I come across and stay active on [GitHub](https://github.com/bmsohwinc)/[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9247555/bms-bharadwaj), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sourabha235/)/[Twitter](https://twitter.com/BmSourabha).

I graduated from [IIT Bhubaneswar](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/) in 2021 with a B.Tech (Honors) in Computer Science and Engineering.

During my undergraduate, I was strongly associated with [Dr. Sudipta Saha](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile.php/sudipta/)'s research group [Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)](https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg), working on projects spun across Wireless Networks, Operating Systems, X11 Windows, and Computer Vision.

Outside work, I like gardening and reading books.
